         AI Analysis Engine
                ↓
    Visual Canvas Rendering
```

### AI Algorithm Overview

**Deadline Risk Prediction**:
```typescript
1. Filter nodes with due dates in next 7 days
2. Count urgent/high priority items
3. Calculate risk: 3+ urgent = HIGH, 5+ total = MEDIUM
4. Return actionable message
```

**Conflict Detection**:
```typescript
1. Group nodes by due date
2. Identify dates with 3+ items or 2+ urgent items
3. Flag reminders without due dates
4. Return conflict warnings
```

**Workload Analysis**:
```typescript
1. Count nodes by priority level
2. Calculate percentage distribution
3. Provide recommendations based on balance
```
